# Turing Machine Haskell Emulator

**This project it's separated in 3 parts:**

  - Emulator itself (TMemulator.hs).
  - Read file module (TMfiles.hs).
  - .tm File extension.

The first one it's a program that essentially takes a Turing Machine, an initial word and returns either the final word or every word in a sequential order.

**Here it's an example of how it works with the ``` example.tm``` file:**
```
computer:~/Turing-Machine-Emulator$ ghc -O TMemulator.hs
computer:~/Turing-Machine-Emulator$ ./TMemulator

 Turing Machine Path:
 example.tm

 Initial Tape:
 0011

 Visible length of the Tape:
 10

 Just final tape[0], or every step[1]?:
 1
 .....[0]011..
 .....[0]11...
 ....0[1]1....
 ...01[1].....
 ..011[.].....
 ...01[1].....
 ....0[1].....
 .....[0]1....
 .....[.]01...
 .....[0]1....
 .....[1].....
 ....1[.].....
 .....[1].....
 .....[.].....
 .....[.].....
 .....[.].....
 .....[.].....

The second part have only one objective, and it's to read a ```.tm``` file and transform the information in it, in to a useful data.

And lastly but not leastly, is the ```.tm``` file extension. This extension doesn't have any property by itself, it's just a nice way to indicate that it's a file that represent a Turing machine in a way that this emulator can read. In fact you can give to the emulator a ```.txt``` file, and will perfectly work if it's correctly written.  To understand how exactly a Turing Machine must be represented in this type of files, read the explanation below.

## .tm File extension explained:

**To understand this easier, you might want to have a new window with the ```exmple.tm``` file open**

**The first thing that you have to know it's that every line that starts with ```;;``` it's a commentary. Other than that, there are just three parts to talk about**
  - Initial State.
  - Blank Symbol.
  - Rules.

**A Turing Machine it's usually defined as a 7-tuple, where the elements are:**
 1. A finite non-empty set of States.
 2. A finite non-empty set of alphabet symbols.
 3. A symbol that represents a blank slot of the Tape.
 4. A set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial Tape.
 5. The Rules, usually defined as a function.
 6. The Initial State.
 7. A set of the accepting final or terminating states.

See:[ Wikipedia Turing Machine formal-definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Formal_definition) for more information.

1. **In this program the set of states**, it's given by the states that appear in the Rules.

2. **The alphabet**, it's given by the characters that are used on the rules, or if you want, the characters allowed by the program or the terminal in use.

3. **The blank symbol** has to be explicitly specified on the file, and it's done like this: ``` Blank = . ``` in a new line before the rules. In this case, the blank symbol would be a ```.``` (a dot), and it's important that the ```Blank```  part,the first letter must be capitalized.

4. **The set of allowed symbols** (characters) that may appear in the initial tape, are just the characters allowed by the program or the Terminal.

5. **To define the rules** of a Turing Machine you must write ```Rules = ```, and after that, you write every rule you need. But a rule itself has a syntax too.   Every rule will be a 5 elements tuple, where this, will be separated by spaces.

  Example :  The rules ``` (A 1 0 -> B)``` means, that if the machine it's in the state ```A``` and sees a ```1``` then, replace it by ```0``` move to the ```->``` (right), and change to state ```B```.  Where the first element it's a Haskell-String, the second and the third are characters, the forth can be either ``` -> (right), <- (left) or >< (Stay)```, and the fifth element is again a Haskell-String, in the sense that they can be larger then 1 character, because there are just names for states, not symbols.

6. **The Initial State** it has to be specified, and it's very similar to the blank symbol and the rules. The example ```Initial = A``` it is a definition of a Initial state, just as it's in the ````example.tm ``` file.

7. **The accepting final states** it's not specified in this emulator, we just assume that the machine will end when there isn't any rule that can be applied, on the current state with the current tape and the current place of the head.
